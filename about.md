# How to use the EVERSE Technology Radar

### Introduction

Technology Watch(TW), developed as part of EVERSE project, contains a collection of software quality tools and their metadata in terms of quality indicators and quality dimentions. It contains all the tools for research software quality that align, adapt, and extend to the specific needs of various research communities.


### What is the EVERSE Technology Radar?

The Tech Radar provides an overview of different technologies, including languages, frameworks,
tools, and patterns, as well as platforms, that we consider 'new or noteworthy.' The radar does not
cover all established technologies; instead, it focuses on items that have recently gained
significance or undergone changes. Items previously featured in the radar are not listed on the
homepage but remain available in the complete overview and search.

### How it is created

The items in the technology radar are suggested by different teams, many of which are related to the
work and challenges faced by the teams in various projects. In fact, we do not include anything on
the radar that we haven't personally tested at least once.

Numerous valuable discussions have taken place in various expert groups regarding the classification
and details of each technology and innovation. The culmination of these discussions is reflected in
the latest technology radar.

### How should it be used

The radar serves as an overview of technologies that we believe everyone in the teams should be
aware of at present.

Its goal is to guide and inspire daily work within the teams. Additionally, it aims to provide
valuable information and a high-level perspective to enable decisions to be made with a deeper
understanding of the subject matter, resulting in more informed and coordinated choices.

We also hope that developers outside of EVERSE will find the information in our technology overview
inspiring.

We categorize the items into four quadrants, and sometimes, when it's not entirely clear where an
item belongs, we choose the best fit.

#### The quadrants are:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** In this category, we include development languages like Scala or
  Golang, as well as low-level development frameworks such as Play or Symfony. These are valuable
  for implementing various types of custom software.
- **Tools:** This section is dedicated to a wide range of software tools, from small utilities to
  more extensive software projects.
- **Methods & Patterns:** Patterns hold enduring significance, with many of them standing the test
  of time compared to some tools or frameworks. This category is where we provide information on
  methods and patterns related to development, continuous integration, testing, organization,
  architecture, and more.
- **Platforms & Operations:** In this quadrant, we group technologies related to the operation of
  software, infrastructure, and platform-related tools and services.

#### Each of the items is classified in one of these rings:

- **analysis code:** We wholeheartedly recommend this technology. It has been extensively used in many teams
  for an extended period, proving its stability and utility.
- **prototype tools:** We have successfully implemented this technology and suggest taking a closer look at it
  in this category. The aim here is to scrutinize these items more closely with the intention of
  elevating them to the 'Adopt' level.
- **research infrastructure software:** We have experimented with this technology and find it promising. We recommend
  exploring these items when you encounter a specific need for the technology in your project.
